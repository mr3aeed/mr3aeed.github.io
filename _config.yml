  Hi, I'm machine learning engineer with over 4 years of experience in implementing and analyzing machine learning and deep learning models. I have a solid understanding of mathematics and statistics, and I am interested in the applications and challenges of machine learning in real-world problems.

          In my thesis, I designed an obstacle-constrained environment using Python to simulate the problem of sensor data collection by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the IoT networks. 
          I developed deep reinforcement learning models using Tensorflow to enable the UAV agents to fly safely towards the sensors and collection their data, leading to two publications and achieving 7% reduction in sensors energy consumption comparing to fixed-power baseline.
          I was also a teaching assistant in multiple related courses: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and Software Design.

          I developed a framework for indoor localization of WiFi users using Auto-Encoders with mean localization error of 0.9 meter. As a teaching assistant, I ran tutorial classes on probability and statistics for the graduate course Pattern Recognition.

          I started my undergrad studies in electrical engineering, which helped me to strenghten my math and engineering foundations. Then, to become more familiar with machine learning, I took two graduate courses and a minor in computer engineering. In my BSc research, I used auto encoders to predict users' locations in an indoor localization problem.

      Alongside my interests in AI and science, I do photography wheneveer I get a chance (checkout my instagram). I love exploring the nature and hiking, as an outdoor kind of person :)
