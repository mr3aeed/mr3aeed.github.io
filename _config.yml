          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

I started my undergrad studies in electrical engineering, which helped me to strenghten my math and engineering foundations. Then, to become more familiar with machine learning, I took two graduate courses and a minor in computer engineering. In my BSc research, I used auto encoders to predict users' locations in an indoor localization problem.
